## Support E-liss AI Tools  

E-liss AI provides advanced tools that integrate seamlessly with Solana trading platforms. These tools were designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring traders at all levels can use them effectively. Key functionalities include:  

- **Market Analysis API**: Enables real-time tracking of market trends and price fluctuations.  
- **Risk Management Advisor**: Suggests strategies to minimize losses during volatile market conditions.  
- **Automated Backtesting**: Allows users to test trading strategies against historical data.  

### Example: Market Analysis  
Here's how E-liss provides real-time market analysis using its intuitive API integration:  

```python
def fetch_market_data(token: str):
    url = f"https://api.eliss-market.com/data?token={token}&apikey={os.getenv('API_KEY')}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": "Market data unavailable."}

# Usage
market_data = fetch_market_data("SOL")
print(f"Current Price: {market_data['price']}")
```

This function connects directly to the E-liss Market API and retrieves up-to-date price data.
